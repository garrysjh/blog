## Entries

### Day 1
###### 11/5/2022 11:13PM 

I made an account on Github! Started this repository and learnt about the syntax for github, such as pull requests, commits, branches. Still not sure how to navigate branches but branches : editing a separate version of the repository / project that u can merge with the main branch without editing the original one. Rest are quite common sensical imo.

I also opened a github page which is where this blog is being hosted on, and simple Markdown. For the next few days, I intend on learning HTML and CSS so that I can move these entries to a nicer webpage, and eventually make a portfolio for these. 

So, these blog entries are supposed to be daily entries, where I learn something new everyday so that I can make sure that I'm committed to learning useful skills.

See you tomorrow!
